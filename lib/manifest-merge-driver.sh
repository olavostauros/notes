# manifest-merge-driver.sh — custom git merge driver for .manifest files
#
# Git calls this with: %O %A %B (ancestor, ours, theirs)
# The driver must write the merged result to %A and exit 0 on success,
# non-zero on conflict.
#
# Manifest format: <id>\t<name>, sorted by name, one entry per line.
#
# Strategy: union merge — all unique entries from both sides are kept.
# Deletions are respected (entry in ancestor + one side, missing from other).
#
# When both sides independently add the same filename with different random
# IDs (common when two branches create the same note), we prefer ours.
# A true conflict is when the ancestor had an entry and both sides changed
# its ID differently (which shouldn't happen in normal operation).
#
# Bash 3.2 compatible (no associative arrays).
#
# Known limitation: pure renames (same ID, different name across branches)
# could result in two names pointing to one ID. In practice this doesn't
# happen because rename = delete old + create new with new ID under the
# current obfuscate logic. If rename-in-place is ever added, this driver
# should detect the "two names → one ID" case.
